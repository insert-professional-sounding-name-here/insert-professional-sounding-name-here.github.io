# IPSNH.github.io MazeMap

Welcome to the insert-professional-sounding-name-here.github.io. This site is used to host the embedded map for our uni assignment app.

## The App
Our assignment brief is to create a application which helps disabled students get to know the Preston campus here at UCLan. Apart of this app we will embed a top down map view of the campus via a website using HTML and a small part of javascript.

## MazeMap
MazeMap is a wayfinding application used to help users find their way around certain mapped campuses around the world. Many of these campuses are universities including the UCLan Preston campus, which our assignment brief is focused around.
